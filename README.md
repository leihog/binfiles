binfiles
========

A collection of scripts / utilities that I tend to use a lot.

- genpass     - A simple password generator
- counter     - A tool to count occurrences of characters
- git-fmd     - Generates a Flattr button in markdown using config values from a local git repo
- git-lint    - Check for syntax errors in modified files in current git repo. Only supports PHP atm
- keg         - an abstraction of the jungle that is dpkg and apt-\*
- ssh-copykey - Will transfer your ssh pub key to remote hosts. For systems
                where ssh-copy-id is missing (OSX)
- ssh-keylist - List and show keys from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- vim         - a simple util to start macvim if available

Installation
------------

Run **link2bin**, this will symlink all the utilities in to your *~/bin* directory. If you don't have a *~/bin* directory one will be created for you. 

Add *~/bin* to your $PATH.

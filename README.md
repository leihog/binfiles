binfiles
========

A collection of scripts / utilities that I tend to use a lot.

* git-fmd - Genereates a Flattr button in markdown using config values from a local git repo
* vim - a simple util to start macvim if available
* keg - an abstraction of the jungle that is dpkg and apt-*
* copy-sshkey - Will transfer your ssh pub key to remote hosts. For systems
  where ssh-copy-id is missing (OS X).
* counter - A tool to count occurrences of characters

Installation
------------

Run **link2bin**, this will symlink all the utilities in to your *~/bin* directory. If you don't have a *~/bin* directory one will be created for you. 

Add *~/bin* to your $PATH.
